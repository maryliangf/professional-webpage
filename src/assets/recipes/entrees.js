      "Ahhh. Banana bread. Two words that should always go together. You bet I will voluntarily let my bananas get so ripe and freckled that it'll give me an excuse to make this recipe. It sparks so much joy to have a batch of these ready so I can have them whenever I want. To be completely honest, mine does not ever make it to the freezer because it ends up in my tummy. I created this no sugar added recipe because all the banana breads I had tried or bought have been too sweet for me. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",
    info:
      'Enjoy this naturally sweetened, moist, and tender coconut flour banana bread (no added sugars!) as a snack, dessert, or breakfast. It is not only super easy to make, but you can also customize it with whatever toppings you like or have on hand.',
